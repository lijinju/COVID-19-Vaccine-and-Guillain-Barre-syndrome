## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the data processing pipeline and analytic code for a large-scale retrospective cohort study evaluating the incidence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) following COVID-19 vaccination.

The pipeline is built on the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and incorporates epidemiological safeguards to address immortal time bias, competing risks, and surveillance bias.

### Cohort Allocation
Study participants were assigned to mutually exclusive exposure groups according to the first qualifying event occurring on or after December 11, 2020.

- **Vaccination Cohort**: Index date defined by the first (or second, for dose-specific analyses) COVID-19 vaccine administration.

- **Infection Cohort**: Index date defined by the first documented SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Well care Visit Control Cohort**: Index date defined by the routine medical visit / well-check, serving as a contemporary control group to account for healthcare-seeking behavior.

We additionally evaluated a sequential exposure cohort consisting of individuals who received COVID-19 vaccination and subsequently developed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Study Period & Follow-up

The study period spans from **1 year prior to the index date** through **90 days post-index** (post-exposure).

- **Index event:** The first occurrence of vaccination, infection, or a well-care visit (per cohort assignment above).
- **Look-back period:** A 1-year window before the index date was used to assess demographics and comorbidities, restricting the analysis to new-onset (incident) conditions.
- **Exclusion criterion:** Participants with a GBS diagnosis within 365 days prior to the index date were excluded.

**Follow-up windows:**
- **Primary analysis:** 30 days post-index.
- **Secondary analyses:** Extended to 60 and 90 days post-index.

**Censoring:** Participants were censored at the end of their respective follow-up window (30/60/90 days) if no GBS event occurred, or at death if it occurred within the follow-up period.

### Epidemiological Surveillance Measures

- **Prevalent Case Exclusion:** 365-day look-back to exclude patients with prior GBS diagnoses.
- **Competing Risks:** Survival time is censored at the date of death if the patient dies before developing GBS.
- **Surveillance Bias Adjustment:** Baseline healthcare utilization (outpatient, ER, and inpatient visit counts) is calculated and adjusted for.
